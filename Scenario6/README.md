# GovCloud Secure Infrastructure Pipeline

## Overview
This solution implements a highly secure, compliant, and automated infrastructure pipeline specifically designed for GovCloud environments. It addresses the stringent security requirements, compliance standards (FedRAMP, NIST, CMMC), and operational constraints of government cloud deployments.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Security-First Pipeline Design
**Implementation:**
- Multi-layer security scanning (Checkov, Snyk, CodeQL, KICS, Anchore)
- Secure boundary VPCs with strict egress control
- Image hardening through Packer
- Automated compliance verification

**Reasoning:**
- Government workloads require highest security standards
- Zero-trust architecture principles
- Defense-in-depth approach
- Automated security gates prevent non-compliant deployments

### 2. Compliance Automation
**Implementation:**
- FedRAMP controls verification
- NIST 800-53 compliance checks
- CMMC validation
- Automated compliance reporting

**Reasoning:**
- Reduces manual compliance overhead
- Ensures consistent compliance state
- Provides audit-ready documentation
- Maintains continuous compliance

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Implementation:**
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Version-controlled configurations
- State management with encrypted backend
- Policy as Code with Sentinel

**Reasoning:**
- Reproducible infrastructure
- Change tracking and audit
- Reduced human error
- Consistent deployments

### 4. Secure Network Architecture
**Implementation:**
- Secure boundary VPCs
- Strict egress controls
- Network segmentation
- Flow logging and monitoring

**Reasoning:**
- Data sovereignty requirements
- Traffic control and monitoring
- Attack surface reduction
- Compliance with security controls

## Key Components

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci-cd/github-actions/govcloud-pipeline.yml`)
- Pre-deployment security checks
- Infrastructure validation
- Compliance verification
- Automated rollback capabilities

### 2. Security Controls
- SAST/DAST scanning
- Container security
- IaC security scanning
- Artifact signing

### 3. Compliance Framework
- Automated controls verification
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Audit logging
- Compliance reporting

### 4. Network Security
- VPC security groups
- NACLs
- Flow logs
- Traffic monitoring

## Problem Resolution
