# RBAC Federation Implementation for Enterprise Kubernetes Platform

## Context

Our enterprise platform needs to support 20+ application teams with secure, scalable access management across Dev, QA, and Production EKS clusters.

## Decision

Implement federated RBAC using Azure AD as the primary identity provider with:

- Multi-tenant isolation
- Environment-specific access controls
- GitOps-driven RBAC management
- Automated tenant onboarding

## Implementation Details

### 1. Identity Federation

- Azure AD SSO integration for all clusters
- Group-based access mapping
- MFA enforcement for production access
- Service account automation for CI/CD

### 2. Access Control Structure

- Tenant isolation through namespaces
- Progressive access restrictions
- Automated role propagation
- Policy enforcement via OPA

### 3. Security Controls

- Strict tenant boundaries
- Service mesh authentication
- Audit logging
- Compliance reporting

## Consequences

### Positive

- Centralized identity management
- Consistent access patterns
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Clear tenant boundaries

### Negative

- Additional complexity in tenant onboarding
- Need for careful policy management
- Identity provider dependency
