# Enterprise Kubernetes Platform as a Product

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Enterprise Kubernetes Platform designed for multiple business units in a Fortune 500 company. The platform provides a centralized, self-service Kubernetes environment with robust security, observability, and cost management features.

## Platform Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Multi-tenant EKS Clusters**
   - Production, QA, and Development environments
   - Managed by Rancher for unified control plane
   - Tenant isolation through namespaces and network policies

2. **Service Mesh (Istio)**
   - mTLS for service-to-service encryption
   - Traffic management and canary deployments
   - Service-level observability

3. **Network Isolation (Calico)**
   - Micro-segmentation with network policies
   - Tenant isolation at the network level
   - Egress and ingress control

4. **Ingress Strategy (NGINX)**
   - Domain-based routing for 200+ services
   - Sharding for high-volume services
   - Rate limiting and traffic management

5. **GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD)**
   - Self-service application deployment
   - Multi-project organization
   - Environment promotion workflows

6. **Identity and Access (OIDC/SSO)**
   - Federation with Azure AD
   - Role-based access control
   - Environment-specific permissions

7. **Cost Monitoring (Kubecost)**
   - Tenant-level cost attribution
   - Chargeback reporting
   - Optimization recommendations

## Tenant Onboarding

### Prerequisites

Before onboarding a new tenant, ensure:

1. Azure AD group is created for the tenant team
2. Git repository is created for tenant applications
3. Cost center is assigned for chargeback

### Onboarding Process

1. Run the onboarding script:
   ```bash
   ./onboard.sh <tenant-name> <environment> <team-name> <cost-center> <department>
   ```

2. Provide tenant documentation to the team:
   - Access information
   - Resource quotas
   - GitOps workflow
   - Cost monitoring

3. Schedule onboarding session to walk through:
   - Platform capabilities
   - Self-service features
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Cost management

## Platform Capabilities

### Self-Service GitOps

Tenants can deploy applications using GitOps workflows:

1. Commit Kubernetes manifests to tenant repository
2. ArgoCD automatically syncs changes to the cluster
3. Promotion between environments through Git branches or paths

### Network Isolation

Each tenant operates in an isolated network environment:

1. Calico network policies restrict communication between namespaces
2. Istio service mesh provides mTLS for service-to-service communication
3. Egress control limits external communication

### Cost Management

Tenants have visibility into their resource costs:

1. Namespace-level cost attribution
2. Daily, weekly, and monthly reports
3. Optimization recommendations

### Observability

Comprehensive monitoring and logging:

1. Prometheus for metrics collection
2. Grafana dashboards for visualization
3. Distributed tracing with Jaeger
4. Centralized logging with Elasticsearch

## Security Features

### Multi-Tenant Security

1. **Namespace Isolation**
   - Resource quotas
   - Network policies
   - Service mesh boundaries

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - SSO integration with Azure AD
   - RBAC with fine-grained permissions
   - MFA enforcement for production access

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Vault integration
   - Automatic rotation
   - Encrypted storage

4. **Compliance and Auditing**
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Compliance reporting
   - Security scanning

## Best Practices

### Resource Management

1. Set appropriate resource requests and limits
2. Implement horizontal pod autoscaling
3. Use node affinity for workload placement

### Security

1. Follow least privilege principle
2. Implement network policies for all namespaces
3. Scan container images for vulnerabilities

### Cost Optimization

1. Right-size resource requests
2. Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
3. Implement autoscaling for variable workloads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application Deployment Failures**
   - Check ArgoCD sync status
   - Verify Kubernetes manifests
   - Check resource quotas

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   - Verify network policies
   - Check service mesh configuration
   - Inspect ingress rules

3. **Performance Problems**
   - Review resource utilization
   - Check for noisy neighbors
   - Analyze service mesh telemetry
