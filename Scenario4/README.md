# AI-driven Observability Pipeline for E-commerce

This solution implements an advanced observability system powered by AI/ML for a large-scale e-commerce platform with 500+ microservices.

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture-diagram.png)

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection**
   - OpenTelemetry collectors and agents for 500+ microservices
   - Custom instrumentation for business-specific metrics
   - Distributed tracing with context propagation

2. **Data Processing**
   - Kafka for real-time metrics streaming
   - Prometheus for metrics storage and querying
   - Thanos for long-term metrics retention
   - Jaeger for distributed trace analysis

3. **AI/ML Integration**
   - SageMaker endpoints for anomaly detection
   - Dynamic thresholds for alerting
   - Predictive performance analysis
   - Automated root cause analysis

4. **Visualization**
   - Custom Grafana dashboards for different teams
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Unified view of logs, metrics, and traces
   - Business and technical KPIs
