# Edge Computing Platform with Offline Operations and Progressive Rollouts

## Requirement

Deploy and manage edge devices (AWS Greengrass / Azure IoT Edge) with centralized GitOps-controlled updates via ArgoCD, capable of rollback and real-time telemetry, with robust support for offline operations and synchronized updates.

## Challenges

- Over-the-air updates using progressive rollout (blue/green & canary)
- Limited connectivity environments – need local caching + sync
- GitOps integration with device state management
- Multi-tenant edge deployments with centralized monitoring
- Secure secret distribution (Vault Agent on edge, short-lived tokens)
- Offline operations with data synchronization when connectivity is restored
- Conflict resolution for data modified during offline periods

## Overview

This solution implements a comprehensive edge computing platform with robust offline operations and progressive rollout capabilities. It provides a centralized GitOps-controlled edge device management system using AWS Greengrass and Azure IoT Edge, with ArgoCD for deployment management, enhanced with sophisticated offline synchronization and progressive rollout mechanisms.

## Architecture Overview

The solution consists of:

- **Multi-cloud edge device management** (AWS Greengrass / Azure IoT Edge)
- **Centralized GitOps control plane** using ArgoCD
- **Progressive rollout system** with phased deployment capabilities:
  - Percentage-based rollout with configurable phases
  - Automatic and manual approval gates
  - Metric-based promotion criteria
  - Automated rollback on failure
- **Offline operations system** with:
  - Local data caching and prioritization
  - Conflict resolution strategies
  - Bandwidth-efficient synchronization
  - Compression and encryption of synchronized data
- **Secure secret management** with HashiCorp Vault
- **Comprehensive monitoring and telemetry pipeline**

## Key Features

### Offline Operations and Synchronized Updates

The platform includes a sophisticated offline operations system that allows edge devices to continue functioning during network outages:

- **Local Data Caching**: Edge devices maintain a local cache of critical data using BadgerDB, a high-performance key-value store.
- **Data Prioritization**: The system prioritizes critical data types (telemetry, alerts, logs) for synchronization when connectivity is limited.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Built-in strategies for resolving conflicts when data is modified both locally and remotely during offline periods.
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Incremental synchronization with compression to minimize bandwidth usage.
- **Secure Synchronization**: All synchronized data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

### Progressive Rollout System

The platform includes a sophisticated progressive rollout system for safe and controlled updates to edge devices:

- **Phased Deployments**: Updates are rolled out in configurable phases, targeting increasing percentages of devices.
- **Approval Gates**: Critical phases can require manual approval before proceeding.
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of device health metrics during rollout.
- **Automatic Rollback**: Automatic rollback if health metrics exceed thresholds.
- **Deterministic Device Selection**: Consistent device selection in each phase based on device ID hashing.

## Offline Sync Manager

The Offline Sync Manager (`edge-components/offline-sync/sync-manager.go`) provides:

- Persistent local storage using BadgerDB
- Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
- Conflict resolution for data modified during offline periods
- Bandwidth-efficient incremental synchronization
- Prioritization of critical data types

## Progressive Rollout Manager

The Progressive Rollout Manager (`edge-components/rollout/progressive-rollout.go`) provides:

- Phased deployment of updates to edge devices
- Percentage-based targeting with deterministic device selection
- Automatic and manual approval gates
- Health monitoring during rollout
- Automatic rollback on failure

## Getting Started

See [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment-guide.md) for setup instructions.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the required infrastructure using Terraform:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform/environments/dev
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
3. Deploy the edge components:
   ```bash
   cd ../../../../
   ./scripts/deploy-edge-components.sh dev
   ```
4. Configure offline synchronization:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/configure-offline-sync.sh dev
