# Enterprise Multi-Project CI/CD Pipeline with Pulumi

This implementation uses Pulumi with TypeScript to create a sophisticated, enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline for managing 5 projects with 10 microservices across multiple environments and regions.

## Architecture Overview

The solution implements a GitOps-based CI/CD approach using:

1. **Pulumi** for infrastructure as code
2. **Kubernetes (EKS)** for container orchestration
3. **Flux CD** for GitOps-based continuous deployment
4. **Multi-region deployment** for high availability
5. **Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack** for observability
6. **HashiCorp Vault** for secret management
7. **Network Policies** for secure communication

## Key Features

### Advanced Error Handling and Resilience

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures by stopping operations after consecutive failures
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed operations with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues deployment even if non-critical components fail
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and auditing

### Automated Verification

- **Health Checks**: Verifies cluster and service health after deployment
- **Compliance Checks**: Ensures infrastructure meets security and compliance requirements
- **Drift Detection**: Identifies and reports configuration drift
- **Automated Rollback**: Reverts to previous state if verification fails

### Security Controls

- **Network Policies**: Restricts communication between services
- **Secret Management**: Securely stores and manages secrets with HashiCorp Vault
- **Pod Security Policies**: Enforces security best practices for pods
- **Security Scanning**: Identifies vulnerabilities in code and infrastructure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- Pulumi CLI 3.x or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- kubectl for interacting with Kubernetes clusters

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Initialize Pulumi stacks:
   ```bash
   pulumi stack init dev
   pulumi stack init staging
   pulumi stack init prod
   ```

### Deployment

1. Preview changes:
   ```bash
   npm run preview:dev
   ```
2. Deploy infrastructure:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:dev
   ```

## Multi-Environment Strategy

The solution supports three environments:

1. **Development**: Single-region deployment for development and testing
2. **Staging**: Dual-region deployment for pre-production validation
3. **Production**: Triple-region deployment for high availability

## Security Features

- **Zero-Trust Network Model**: All communication is explicitly allowed through network policies
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault for secure secret storage and rotation
- **Least Privilege**: Service accounts with minimal permissions
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics**: Prometheus for collecting and storing metrics
- **Dashboards**: Grafana for visualizing metrics
- **Logging**: ELK stack for centralized logging
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Alerting**: Alertmanager for notifications

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Code Validation**: Linting, testing, and security scanning
2. **Infrastructure Preview**: Preview changes before deployment
3. **Deployment**: Deploy infrastructure with Pulumi
4. **Verification**: Verify deployment with health checks
5. **Notification**: Notify stakeholders of deployment status

## Disaster Recovery

The solution includes disaster recovery capabilities:

1. **Multi-Region Deployment**: Services run in multiple regions
2. **Automated Backups**: Regular backups of critical data
3. **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatic failover to healthy regions
4. **Runbooks**: Documented procedures for disaster recovery

## Compliance and Governance

The solution includes compliance and governance features:

1. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit purposes
2. **Compliance Checks**: Automated checks for compliance requirements
3. **Policy Enforcement**: Enforces security and compliance policies
4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for compliance audits
