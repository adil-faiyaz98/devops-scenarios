# DevOps Scenarios - Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure Solutions

Collection of infrastructure solutions for various real-world scenarios. Each scenario represents a common challenge faced by organizations and provides a comprehensive solution with infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and best practices.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A reference architecture for enterprise DevOps implementations
- A showcase of best practices for various cloud and infrastructure scenarios
- A learning resource for DevOps engineers and architects
- A template that can be adapted for real-world implementations

## Scenarios Overview

### Scenario 1: Enterprise Multi-Project CI/CD Pipeline

A high-availability CI/CD pipeline implementation with zero downtime deployments, security best practices, and comprehensive monitoring. Designed for organizations managing multiple projects with frequent releases and strict security requirements.

### Scenario 2: Multi-Cloud FinTech Platform Infrastructure

A multi-region, multi-account, hybrid-cloud architecture across AWS and Azure, ensuring PCI-DSS compliance and high availability with zero trust security and robust disaster recovery capabilities (RTO < 5 min, RPO < 1 min).

### Scenario 3: Enterprise Kubernetes Platform as a Product

A centralized Kubernetes platform (EKS/GKE + Rancher/Anthos) for 20+ application teams with self-service GitOps, cost monitoring, RBAC, and secrets management. Features multi-tenant isolation, ArgoCD integration, and comprehensive ingress strategy.

### Scenario 4: AI-driven Observability Pipeline for E-commerce

An AI/ML-powered observability system using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and SageMaker integration for anomaly detection. Designed for large-scale e-commerce platforms with 500+ microservices requiring advanced monitoring.

### Scenario 5: Edge Computing Platform

An edge computing platform with distributed deployment capabilities, offline operations, and synchronized updates. Implements over-the-air updates using progressive rollout strategies and GitOps integration with device state management.

### Scenario 6: GovCloud Secure Infrastructure Pipeline

A hardened infrastructure deployment in AWS GovCloud, adhering to FedRAMP High, NIST 800-53, and CIS benchmarks. Features compliance-as-code, immutable infrastructure with automated image hardening, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Getting Started

Each scenario directory contains:

- `README.md` - Detailed description of the scenario and solution
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Specific requirements addressed by the solution
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline configurations (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
- Documentation and implementation guides

To explore a scenario:

1. Navigate to the scenario directory
2. Review the README.md for an overview
3. Examine the REQUIREMENTS.md for specific requirements
4. Explore the implementation details in the subdirectories

## Implementation Notes

- All solutions follow infrastructure-as-code best practices
- Security is integrated throughout the entire lifecycle
- CI/CD pipelines include proper validation, testing, and verification
- Monitoring and observability are key components of each solution
- Disaster recovery and high availability are considered in all designs
