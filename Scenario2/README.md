# Multi-Cloud FinTech Platform Infrastructure

## Requirement

Design and implement a multi-region, multi-account, hybrid-cloud architecture across AWS and Azure, ensuring compliance (PCI-DSS) and high availability with zero trust security and disaster recovery (RTO < 5 min, RPO < 1 min).

## Challenges

- Federated IAM across AWS IAM, Azure AD, and Okta
- Global DNS with geolocation failover (Route53 + Azure Traffic Manager)
- Cross-cloud VPC peering (Transit Gateway, Azure VNet Peering + ExpressRoute)
- Consistent monitoring and logging (Datadog + Azure Monitor + OpenTelemetry)
- Policy enforcement with OPA and Sentinel across providers

## Overview

This solution implements a secure, compliant, and highly available multi-cloud infrastructure for a FinTech platform across AWS and Azure. The architecture follows zero trust principles and meets PCI-DSS requirements while ensuring robust disaster recovery capabilities.

## Key Features

- Multi-region, multi-account architecture across AWS and Azure
- PCI-DSS compliant infrastructure with zero trust security
- High availability with RTO < 5 min and RPO < 1 min
- Federated identity management across AWS IAM, Azure AD, and Okta
- Global DNS load balancing with geolocation-based failover
- Secure cross-cloud networking with VPC peering
- Unified monitoring and logging solution
- Policy as Code implementation with OPA and Sentinel

## Architecture Components

1. Identity and Access Management

   - Okta as the primary IdP
   - Federation with AWS IAM and Azure AD
   - Zero trust network access

2. Networking

   - AWS Transit Gateway and Azure ExpressRoute
   - Cross-cloud VPC/VNet peering
   - Global load balancing

3. Security

   - PCI-DSS compliance controls
   - Policy enforcement with OPA
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Security monitoring and alerting

4. Monitoring and Logging

   - Centralized logging with OpenTelemetry
   - Datadog for unified monitoring
   - Azure Monitor integration

5. Disaster Recovery
   - Active-active multi-region setup
   - Automated failover procedures
   - Regular DR testing framework
